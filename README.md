# Generation Ship

This is a humble attempt to join [Gamedev.js 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gamedevjs-2023) game jam. The theme of the jam is
"Time". This game is a time/resource management game where you have to manage a generation ship during its travel to a
new distant planet. The game is not finished entirely & poorly balanced, but it's mostly playable.
